## Sully's Mod

### 📘About:

Sully’s Mod started out a few years ago when I decided to try and make a minecraft mod. I couldn’t think of a name and called it the first name that came to my head as a placeholder “Sully”, the name stuck and now people think my name is actually Sully. Back then it was made with MCreator and combined with the fact that I back then didn't have a good understanding of vanilla feel, it became more limited each version. I decided to completely revamp the mod, completely dumping the MCreator version and getting a coding team (Uraneptus and MiteBeMana). With each feature I try to think it out as well as I can, making sure the feature is well-balanced, feels fun to play with and overall just feels like something new. It tries it’s best to feel like a Minecraft update full of random features. The mod is planned to have features for every player, explorers, builders and redstone engineers.
