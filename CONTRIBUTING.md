## Contributing to Sully's Mod

First of all we want to thank you for contributing! ðŸŽ‰

Now before you start, we want to mention a few things that you should be aware of before contributing to this project.

**1.** When contributing a data file, like a translation, tag, recipe etc, </br>
please make sure your file is **not** under `src/generated/resources/...` but under `src/main/resources/...`

**2.** When contributing a translation, only translate our mod if you speak the language fluently. Do not use some translation website or app to translate our mod!
From this point on as I'm writing this, I will always have a native speaker check new contributed translations!

**3.** When creating a code contribution please make sure to adopt our naming conventions and our code structure!
- You are **not** allowed to create a code content PR, if it wasn't permissioned by the Team directly
- You are **not** allowed to change anything about the current project structure without our permission
- Make sure your code PR works and proof us, that it runs!

### [These contribution guidlines will likely be extended in the future]
